**Snake Apple Game**

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Snake game with added features, such as a background image, custom graphics, and music integration. Built using the **Pygame library**, the game is interactive and engaging for players of all ages.

**Features**

**Gameplay Mechanics**
- Control a snake that grows in length by eating apples.
- The apple's position is randomized after consumption.
- The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.

**Graphics**
- Enhanced visuals with a custom background image.
- Snake and apple are represented using custom images.

**Audio Integration**
- Background music plays in a loop during gameplay.
- Sound effects for events like eating an apple and collisions.

**Scoring System**
- Displays the player's score, which increases as the snake grows.

**Game Over Screen**
